# Real-time live results board & other tips

- London VueJS Meetup, Thursday 7th July 2016

## Abstract

Part 1; Vue.js, Node, Socket.io, MongoDB working together to create a live results board for sporting events.  
Part 2; Looking behind a larger app and tips learned from both.  

Along the way see how to move from the simpler examples shown on vuejs.org to more complex apps and remain productive. Suited for people fairly new to Vue.js and/or those who have come to it from other languages.
